# PyLinuxCLI

This simple module emulates CLI for linux systems. It can be used locally or over a socket connection. It's very useful for use on mobile devices. For instance, the StartUserSocketTerminal class could be called on termux app on android and interract with a remote device from anywhere.

It's output would look much better with a little customization to filter the input that appears again on the prog output. 

Please see code file for more.
